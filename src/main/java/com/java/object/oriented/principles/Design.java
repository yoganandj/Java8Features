   /* Design has philosophy is based on three things

            DRY (Don't repeat yourself)    Expect Change

                Divide and Conquer

    SOLID Principles:
    S- Single Responsibility Principle - only one context
    O- Open for extension / Closed for modification -  Don't modify existing functionality
    L- Liskov's Substitution Principle
       - If a program is using a Base class, then the reference to the Base class can be
         replaced with a Derived class without affecting the functionality of the program
         Intent -  Derived types must be completely substitute able for their base type.

    I- Interface Segregation Principle -  Do not force irrelevent method or functionality through interface
    D- Dependency Inversion Principle -
