/*
1. Behavior parameterization is a software development pattern that lets you handle frequent
requirement changes
2. means taking a block of code and making it available
without executing it. This block of code can be called later by other parts of your programs
3. which means that you can defer the execution of that block of code
4. you could pass the block of code as an argument to another method that will execute it later.
As a result, the methodâ€™s behavior is parameterized based on that block of code
5. Lambda expressions in Java 8 tackle the problem of verbosity
