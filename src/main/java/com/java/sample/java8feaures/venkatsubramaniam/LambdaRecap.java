    /*
    1. Labmdas enable passing behavior as a parameter or functions as data
    2. Often avoids the need for subclassing
    3. Passing a bit of behavior can
       - reduce boilerplate code
       - reduce conceptual overhead
       - improve abstraction of APIs

    4. We can use lambda for function composition (Higher order functions )
