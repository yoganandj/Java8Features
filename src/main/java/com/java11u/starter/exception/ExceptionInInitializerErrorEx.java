/*  1. The ExceptionInInitializerError is an error because Java failed to load the whole class.
    This failure prevents Java from continuing.

    2. NoClassDefFoundError - A NoClassDefFoundError occurs when Java canâ€™t find the class at
    runtime. Generally, this means a library available when the code was compiled is
    not available when the code is executed.

    3. StackOverflowError - When Java calls methods, it puts parameters and local variables on
    the stack. After doing this a very large number of times, the stack runs out of room and
    overflows
